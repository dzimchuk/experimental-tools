  <!--  This is the file that defines the actual layout and type of the commands.
        It is divided in different sections (e.g. command definition, command
        placement, ...), with each defining a specific set of properties.
        See the comment before each section for more details about how to
        use it. -->

  <!--  The VSCT compiler (the tool that translates this file into the binary
        format that VisualStudio will consume) has the ability to run a preprocessor
        on the vsct file; this preprocessor is (usually) the C++ preprocessor, so
        it is possible to define includes and macros with the same syntax used
        in C++ files. Using this ability of the compiler here, we include some files
        defining some of the constants that we will use inside the file. -->

  <!--This is the file that defines the IDs for all the commands exposed by VisualStudio. -->
  <Extern href="stdidcmd.h"/>

  <!--This header contains the command ids for the menus provided by the shell. -->
  <Extern href="vsshlids.h"/>

  <!--The Commands section is where commands, menus, and menu groups are defined.
      This section uses a Guid to identify the package that provides the command defined inside it. -->
  <Commands package="guidExperimentalToolsPackage">
    <!-- Inside this section we have different sub-sections: one for the menus, another
    for the menu groups, one for the buttons (the actual commands), one for the combos
    and the last one for the bitmaps used. Each element is identified by a command id that
    is a unique pair of guid and numeric identifier; the guid part of the identifier is usually
    called "command set" and is used to group different command inside a logically related
    group; your package should define its own command set in order to avoid collisions
    with command ids defined by other packages. -->

    <!-- In this section you can define new menu groups. A menu group is a container for
         other menus or buttons (commands); from a visual point of view you can see the
         group as the part of a menu contained between two lines. The parent of a group
         must be a menu. -->
    <Groups>
      <Group guid="guidExperimentalToolsPackageCmdSet" id="EditorContextGroup" priority="0x0600">

    <!--Buttons section. -->
    <!--This section defines the elements the user can interact with, like a menu command or a button
        or combo box in a toolbar. -->
    <Buttons>
      <!--To define a menu group you have to specify its ID, the parent menu and its display priority.
          The command is visible and enabled by default. If you need to change the visibility, status, etc, you can use
          the CommandFlag node.
          You can add more than one CommandFlag node e.g.:
              <CommandFlag>DefaultInvisible</CommandFlag>
              <CommandFlag>DynamicVisibility</CommandFlag>
          If you do not want an image next to your command, remove the Icon node /> -->

    <!--The bitmaps section is used to define the bitmaps that are used for the commands.-->
    <Bitmaps>
      <!--  The bitmap id is defined in a way that is a little bit different from the others:
            the declaration starts with a guid for the bitmap strip, then there is the resource id of the
            bitmap strip containing the bitmaps and then there are the numeric ids of the elements used
            inside a button definition. An important aspect of this declaration is that the element id
            must be the actual index (1-based) of the bitmap inside the bitmap strip. -->

  </Commands>

  <!--This section is where you can associate a command with a keyboard shortcut; this association is
  valid within a specific UI context, that is when the shell is inside a specific mode, e.g. during
  debugging, editing a file or when the user is using a specific designer.-->
  <KeyBindings>
    <!--
    To define a binding, we have to specify the sequence of keys to press to activate the command (keystate).
    A key binding can use one or two key and optionally up to two modifiers (Alt, Control or Shift keys); the
    keys are specified using the key1 and key2 attributes (key2 can be omitted) and the modifiers using the
    mod1 and mod2 attributes (both optional).

    The editor attribute is used to specify the UI context that activates the key binding.

    Notice that Visual Studio has a lot of components and commands, so it can be difficult to find a
    key binding not used by somebody else; if the key bindings are conflicting only one will be used
    and one problem is that the shell will not inform the user that a conflict was found. The only
    way to detect the problem is to start Visual Studio under debugger, try to execute any command
    and look if there is a message in the output window about a duplicated accelerator found.
    -->

    <!--
    In this example we want to use the <Control><1> binding for the first command defined in
    the Buttons section above, so this is its definition:
